Text-align is used to align the items in the center of the page.
Margin is used to provide gaps in the page.
To margin the whole page for same value there is no need of writing it 4 times.
To position an element in the page position keyword is used.
there can be three types of positions default one is always static.
relative position is used to position to relate it from the parent page.
absolute position is used when there is no requirement of any relation in the page.
inline keyword is used to make an element in a single line until we ran out of space.
text decoration is used to decorate the text(underline, dotted, dashed etc).
to decorate it we use span keyword to make a sub class if an existing class.
font- To change a font in any web page we use font-family as a keyword and in that we majorly choose serif and sen- serif and after font- family we type the font name then a comma, and in single inverted comma then serif or sen-serif according to requirement.
for Image we can use "flaticon.com".
for GIF's we can use "GIPHY.com".
100% in a webpage is 16px.
when we use float property it will float to the image according to the direction we choose but to avoid certain text to float we use clear to that class.
